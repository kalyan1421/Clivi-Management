# Civil Manager App - Technical Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the Civil Manager Flutter application and its Supabase backend. It is intended for developers, architects, and project stakeholders.

---

## 1️⃣ System Overview

### Purpose
The Civil Manager application is a comprehensive tool designed for construction project management. It facilitates real-time tracking of site operations, resource management, and reporting for civil engineering projects.

### Roles Supported
The system is built around two primary user roles with distinct responsibilities:
*   **Admin / Super Admin:** Have full oversight over all projects, users, and system-wide data. They are responsible for project creation, user management, and high-level reporting.
*   **Site Manager:** Assigned to one or more specific projects. They are responsible for the day-to-day operational logging, including labour attendance, stock consumption, and daily progress reports for their assigned projects only.

### Communication Flow
The Flutter application communicates directly with the Supabase backend via the official `supabase_flutter` client library. All data requests are authenticated and authorized in real-time by Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

*   **API:** The backend exposes a secure RESTful API and a real-time WebSocket interface via PostgREST and Supabase Realtime.
*   **Data Access:** The Flutter app uses the Supabase client to query tables, call RPC functions (`get_dashboard_stats`), and subscribe to real-time changes.
*   **Storage:** Media files (photos, documents) are uploaded directly from the Flutter app to Supabase Storage, with access controlled by storage-specific RLS policies.

### Overall Application Flow
1.  **Authentication:** User logs in with email and password. A `user_profiles` record is automatically created on first signup, defaulting to the `site_manager` role.
2.  **Dashboard:** After login, the user sees a dashboard summarizing key metrics for the projects they have access to (all for Admins, assigned for Site Managers).
3.  **Project Selection:** The user navigates to a specific project.
4.  **Daily Operations:** The Site Manager performs daily tasks:
    *   Logs labour attendance.
    *   Records stock movement (inward/outward).
    *   Uploads daily site photos and progress notes.
    *   Manages project-specific documents (blueprints).
5.  **Admin Functions:** The Admin can:
    *   Create new projects and assign Site Managers.
    *   Manage the master list of stock items and labour.
    *   View consolidated reports across all projects.
    *   Manage user roles and profiles.

## 2️⃣ Authentication & User Profile Architecture

### 2.1 Supabase Auth Flow
The system leverages Supabase's built-in authentication service.

*   **`auth.users` Table:** This is the core table managed by Supabase Auth, storing user identities (email, phone, password hash, etc.). The application code does **not** have direct API access to this table.
*   **Login:** The Flutter app uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` to authenticate the user. Supabase returns a JWT (JSON Web Token) upon successful login.
*   **Session Handling:** The `supabase_flutter` library securely persists the JWT on the device. All subsequent API requests from the client automatically include this token in the Authorization header. Supabase validates the token and makes the user's `uid` and `role` available within RLS policies and database functions.

### 2.2 `user_profiles` Table
A public `user_profiles` table is maintained to store application-specific user data that is not present in `auth.users`.

*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of this table is to store the user's **role** (`admin`, `site_manager`), which is essential for authorization. It also holds metadata like `full_name`, `phone`, and `avatar_url`.
*   **Relationship with `auth.users`:**
    *   It has a one-to-one relationship with `auth.users`, using the user's `id` (a UUID) as both the Primary Key and a Foreign Key referencing `auth.users(id)`.
    *   A database trigger (`on_auth_user_created` executing the `handle_new_user` function) automatically creates a corresponding profile in `user_profiles` whenever a new user signs up in `auth.users`. This ensures data consistency.

---

## 3️⃣ Role & Permission Model

The application uses a simple but effective role-based access control (RBAC) system, enforced at the database level by RLS.

### Super Admin
*   **Responsibilities:** System ownership. Can manage all data, including other Admins. This role is for initial setup and emergency administrative tasks.
*   **Data Ownership:** Owns all data in the system.
*   **Flutter UI Visibility:** Sees all projects, all users, all reports. Has access to system settings and user role management.
*   **Backend Enforcement:** RLS policies often check `role = 'super_admin'` for destructive operations like deleting a project or another user's profile.

### Admin
*   **Responsibilities:** Manages the overall business operations. Creates projects, assigns Site Managers, and views cross-project analytics.
*   **Data Ownership:** Has read/write access to most business data across all projects. Cannot delete other Admins.
*   **Flutter UI Visibility:** Similar to Super Admin but may have fewer system-level configuration options. Can view and manage all projects.
*   **Backend Enforcement:** Most RLS policies use the helper function `is_admin_or_super()` to grant access. This function checks if the current user's role in `user_profiles` is `admin` or `super_admin`.

### Site Manager
*   **Responsibilities:** On-the-ground project execution and reporting. Manages daily logs for their assigned projects.
*   **Data Ownership:** Can only create, view, and update data related to projects they are explicitly assigned to in the `project_assignments` table. They cannot see or interact with data from other projects.
*   **Flutter UI Visibility:** The UI is filtered to show only assigned projects. They cannot see user management or system-wide settings.
*   **Backend Enforcement:** RLS policies for all project-related tables (e.g., `labour`, `stock_items`, `daily_reports`) contain a crucial `WHERE` clause that checks for the user's assignment: `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM project_assignments WHERE project_id = ... AND user_id = auth.uid())`. This is the cornerstone of the security model.

## 6️⃣ Project Lifecycle (Flutter Perspective)

### 6.1 Admin Creates Project
1.  **Flutter UI:** The Admin fills out a form in the Flutter app with the project's `name`, `client_name`, `location`, `budget`, etc.
2.  **Validation:** The app performs basic client-side validation (e.g., required fields).
3.  **Database Insert:** The app calls `supabase.from('projects').insert({...})`.
    *   The RLS policy `"Admins can create projects"` is triggered. It checks if the user's role is `admin` or `super_admin`.
    *   If the check passes, the new project record is inserted into the `projects` table.

### 6.2 Assign Site Manager
1.  **Flutter UI:** From the project settings screen, the Admin selects a user (from a list populated by `user_profiles` where `role = 'site_manager'`) to assign to the current project.
2.  **Database Insert:** The app calls `supabase.from('project_assignments').insert({ project_id: ..., user_id: ... })`.
    *   The RLS policy `"Admins can manage assignments"` is triggered, which verifies the current user is an Admin.
    *   The insert creates the link between the user and the project.
3.  **RLS Dependency:** This `project_assignments` record is now the key that will grant the Site Manager access to all other data related to this `project_id`.
4.  **Common Failure Reasons:** An insert can fail if the Admin's token has expired, or if a unique constraint violation occurs (trying to assign the same user to the same project twice).

### 6.3 Site Manager Project Access
1.  **Flutter UI:** When the Site Manager logs in, their home screen calls `supabase.from('projects').select('*')`.
2.  **Backend Restriction:**
    *   The RLS policy `"Site managers can view assigned projects"` is executed for this `SELECT` query.
    *   The policy performs a subquery on `project_assignments` to find which projects the current user (`auth.uid()`) is linked to.
    *   The database returns **only the project rows** that match the assignment.
    *   The same logic applies to every subsequent query for stock, labour, etc., ensuring perfect data isolation.

## 7️⃣ Stock Management Module

### 7.1 Stock Master (Admin)
The Admin is responsible for the initial setup of the stock master (`stock_items`) for a project. This involves creating entries for every type of material that will be used (e.g., "Cement", "Steel Rebar", "Bricks"). This can be done via a dedicated "Manage Stock" screen in the Flutter app accessible to Admins.

### 7.2 Daily Stock Logs (Site Manager)
The Site Manager is responsible for logging all material movements using the `material_logs` table.
*   **Inward:** When new material arrives on site, the Site Manager creates an `inward` log. This transaction will (via a database trigger or app logic) increase the `quantity` in the corresponding `stock_items` record.
*   **Outward:** When material is consumed for construction, the Site Manager creates an `outward` log. This decreases the `quantity` in `stock_items`.

### 7.3 Balance Calculation Logic
The "current quantity" of a stock item (`stock_items.quantity`) is the canonical value. It is calculated and updated as follows:
`new_quantity = previous_quantity + inward_log_quantity - outward_log_quantity`
This calculation should be handled robustly, ideally within a database transaction or trigger when a `material_logs` entry is created, to prevent race conditions.

### 7.4 Flutter UI Considerations
*   The UI should present a clear form for logging inward/outward stock, including fields for quantity, challan/receipt photo upload, and notes.
*   The main stock list (`stock_items`) should clearly display the `name`, `unit`, and current `quantity`.
*   A "History" view for each stock item should list all its `material_logs` chronologically.

### 7.5 Missing Schema or Improvements
The logic for automatically updating `stock_items.quantity` from `material_logs` is not explicitly defined as a trigger in the provided migrations. This should be implemented as a database trigger to ensure data integrity and prevent the Flutter app from having to perform this calculation.

---

## 8️⃣ Labour Management Module

### 8.1 Labour Profile Creation
Admins or Site Managers create profiles for each laborer in the `labour` table, including their name, skill, and daily wage. This is done per project.

### 8.2 Daily Attendance Logging
1.  The Site Manager selects a date in the Flutter app.
2.  The app fetches all `active` laborers from the `labour` table for the current project.
3.  For each laborer, the Site Manager marks their status (`present`, `absent`, `half_day`).
4.  The app inserts or updates a record in the `labour_attendance` table for that `labour_id` and `date`. The `UNIQUE(labour_id, date)` constraint prevents duplicate entries.

### 8.3 Wage & Cost Calculation
Labour costs can be calculated for any period by querying the `labour_attendance` table:
`total_cost = SUM(l.daily_wage * attendance_multiplier)`
Where `attendance_multiplier` is `1` for 'present', `0.5` for 'half_day', and `0` for 'absent'. This calculation can be done in the Flutter app for reporting or in a database RPC function for more complex analytics.

### 8.4 Flutter Validation Rules
*   The attendance form should default to the current date.
*   The app should prevent marking attendance for future dates.
*   Once attendance is submitted, it might be locked for editing by Site Managers after a certain period (e.g., 24 hours) to ensure data integrity, though this rule is not currently in the schema.

## 9️⃣ Daily Logs & Media Uploads

### Daily Activity Logs
The `daily_reports` table captures the end-of-day summary. The Flutter app presents a simple form with text fields for `work_summary`, `issues`, and `tomorrow_plan`. Site Managers are expected to fill this out daily.

### Photo & Document Uploads
The system uses Supabase Storage for all file uploads.
1.  **Blueprints/Documents:** Files are uploaded to the `blueprints` bucket. The path in the bucket is structured as `{project_id}/{folder_name}/{file_name}`. A corresponding metadata record is created in the `public.blueprints` table.
2.  **Receipts/Bills:** Files are uploaded to a `bills` or `receipts` bucket, likely following a path structure like `{project_id}/{bill_id}/{file_name}`.
3.  **Access Control:** Access to these files is controlled by Storage RLS policies. These policies use helper functions like `is_assigned_to_project_from_path` to parse the `project_id` from the file path and check if the requesting user is assigned to that project. This is a very secure and efficient pattern.

### Time-based Edit Restrictions
The current schema does not enforce time-based editing restrictions (e.g., preventing a Site Manager from editing a daily log after 24 hours). This would be a valuable addition to ensure the immutability of historical records. It can be implemented with an RLS policy on `UPDATE` that checks `created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'`.

### Review & Audit Flow
The `operation_logs` table provides a comprehensive audit trail. It automatically logs key activities like project creation, status changes, and blueprint uploads. The Flutter app can display this as an "Activity Feed" for Admins to monitor system-wide actions.

## 🔟 Row Level Security (RLS) – Deep Dive

### Why RLS is Critical
RLS is the security backbone of this application. It ensures that a user can **only** see the data they are authorized to see, even if the Flutter client code is compromised or a malicious request is attempted. It moves the security logic from the client to the database, which is the single source of truth.

### Admin vs. Site Manager Enforcement
*   **Admin:** RLS policies for Admins are straightforward. They typically start with `USING (public.is_admin_or_super())`, granting wide access. The `is_admin_or_super()` function is a `SECURITY DEFINER` function, meaning it runs with the permissions of the function owner, bypassing RLS to safely check the `role` in `user_profiles` without causing infinite recursion.
*   **Site Manager:** RLS policies for Site Managers are based on project membership. The core logic is almost always: `USING (public.is_assigned_to_project(project_id))`. This function checks if an entry exists in `project_assignments` linking the current user (`auth.uid()`) to the `project_id` of the row being accessed.

### Project-based Access using `EXISTS()`
The pattern `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM project_assignments WHERE ...)` is highly efficient. The database can use indexes on `project_assignments` to very quickly determine if a user has access, without needing to perform a full join.

### Common Supabase RLS Mistakes (and how this schema avoids them)
*   **RLS Recursion:** A common mistake is a policy on `user_profiles` that itself needs to read `user_profiles` to check a role. The schema correctly avoids this by using `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions (`is_admin_or_super`, `get_my_role`), which can bypass RLS for the specific task of checking the role.
*   **Leaking Data in Functions:** All RPC functions (`get_dashboard_stats`, etc.) are designed to respect user roles by filtering data based on the user's accessible projects internally.

### How Flutter Errors Usually Appear
If RLS denies a request:
*   A `SELECT` query will simply return an empty list, as if the data doesn't exist.
*   An `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` will throw a `PostgrestException` with a "new row violates row-level security policy" or "permission denied" message. The Flutter app should handle these exceptions gracefully, informing the user that they don't have permission for the action.

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Missing / Broken / Risky Items

### Problem 1: Inconsistent RPC Function Logic
*   **Problem:** The RPC function `get_project_stats` in migration `016_update_projects.sql` attempts to query a column `entry_type` on the `stock_items` table. This column does not exist. The intended logic was likely to query the `material_logs` table and use its `log_type` column ('inward'/'outward').
*   **Impact on Flutter App:** Calling this RPC function will fail with a SQL error. The project stats dashboard widget will be broken.
*   **Recommended Fix:** The function should be rewritten to `SUM` quantities from the `material_logs` table grouped by `log_type`.

### Problem 2: Missing `vendors` Table
*   **Problem:** The schema uses a simple `TEXT` field (`bills.vendor_name`) for vendors. There is no dedicated `vendors` table.
*   **Impact on Flutter App:** This prevents tracking vendor history, contact information, or outstanding payments across multiple bills. It also allows for data entry errors (e.g., "Vendor A" vs. "vendor a").
*   **Recommended Fix:** Create a `vendors` table with `id`, `name`, `contact_person`, `phone`, etc. Replace `bills.vendor_name` with a `vendor_id UUID` Foreign Key to the new `vendors` table.

### Problem 3: Stock Quantity Calculation is Not Atomic
*   **Problem:** The migrations do not define a database trigger to automatically update `stock_items.quantity` when a log is added to `material_logs`.
*   **Impact on Flutter App:** This puts the responsibility on the Flutter client to perform this critical calculation. If two users perform stock operations simultaneously, a race condition could lead to an incorrect final quantity.
*   **Recommended Fix:** Create a database trigger on the `material_logs` table. After an `INSERT`, this trigger should lock the corresponding row in `stock_items` and update its `quantity` column based on the `log_type` and `quantity` of the new log.

### Problem 4: No Time-Based Edit Locks on Logs
*   **Problem:** There are no RLS policies preventing a Site Manager from modifying or deleting old `labour_attendance` or `daily_reports` records.
*   **Impact on Flutter App:** This can compromise the integrity of historical project data. A user could change a report from weeks ago, affecting historical cost analysis.
*   **Recommended Fix:** Add an `UPDATE` policy to these tables that prevents changes if the record is older than a set period (e.g., 24 or 48 hours), except for Admins. Example policy clause: `USING (created_at > now() - interval '24 hours' OR public.is_admin_or_super())`.

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Recommended Final ER Architecture

For a cleaner, more scalable architecture, the following is recommended:

*   **Clear Table Ownership:**
    *   **Admin-Owned:** `projects`, `user_profiles`, `project_assignments`. These are system-level tables.
    *   **Project-Owned:** All other tables (`stock_items`, `labour`, `daily_reports`, etc.) should be seen as belonging to a project, enforced by the mandatory `project_id` foreign key.
*   **Data Boundaries:** The RLS policies correctly establish strong data boundaries. A Site Manager's entire world exists within the set of `project_id`s they are assigned to. This is a solid foundation for scaling.
*   **Introduce `vendors` and `companies`:**
    *   Add a `vendors` table as mentioned in the previous section.
    *   Activate the `company_id` in `user_profiles` and create a `companies` table. This would allow the entire application to be sold as a multi-tenant SaaS solution in the future, where each client company has its own isolated set of users and projects.
*   **Mermaid ERD Description (Conceptual):**
    ```mermaid
    erDiagram
        auth.users ||--o{ user_profiles : "has one"
        user_profiles ||--|{ projects : "creates"
        user_profiles ||--o{ project_assignments : "is assigned"
        projects ||--|{ project_assignments : "has"
        projects ||--|{ stock_items : "has"
        projects ||--|{ labour : "has"
        projects ||--|{ daily_reports : "has"
        projects ||--|{ blueprints : "has"
        stock_items ||--|{ material_logs : "has logs"
        labour ||--|{ labour_attendance : "has logs"
    ```

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Flutter Development Guidelines

### Structuring Flutter Data Access
*   **Repository Pattern:** Use the Repository Pattern to abstract data sources. Create a `ProjectRepository`, `StockRepository`, etc. These repositories will contain the Supabase query logic.
*   **State Management:** Use a robust state management solution (like Riverpod or Bloc) to manage the application state, fetch data from repositories, and provide it to the UI.
*   **Data Models:** Create Dart classes for each database table (e.g., `Project`, `StockItem`) with `fromJson` and `toJson` methods for easy serialization.

### Best Practices for Supabase Queries
*   **Select Specific Columns:** Always specify the columns you need: `supabase.from('projects').select('id, name, status')`. Avoid `select('*')` in production code.
*   **Use RPC for Complex Logic:** For dashboards or complex calculations, use the existing RPC functions (`get_dashboard_stats`). This is much faster than making multiple separate queries from Flutter.
*   **Real-time:** Use `supabase.from('...').stream(...)` for data that needs to be updated live in the UI, such as the status of a project or the current stock quantity.

### Error Handling Patterns
*   Wrap all Supabase calls in `try...catch` blocks.
*   Specifically catch `PostgrestException` to handle database-related errors (e.g., RLS violations, network issues).
*   Provide user-friendly error messages. If an update fails due to an RLS policy, tell the user "You do not have permission to perform this action" instead of showing a raw database error.

### Security Do’s & Don’ts
*   **DO** rely on RLS for all data security.
*   **DON'T** ever embed a service role key or any other secret in the Flutter application. Use only the `anon_key`.
*   **DO** validate user input on the client side for better UX, but remember that the ultimate security validation happens in the database via RLS and `CHECK` constraints.
*   **DON'T** expose sensitive data in RPC functions that don't check the user's role. All functions should respect the permission model.

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Appendix

### Naming Conventions
*   **Tables:** `snake_case`, plural (e.g., `projects`, `stock_items`).
*   **Columns:** `snake_case` (e.g., `project_id`, `created_at`).
*   **Functions:** `snake_case` (e.g., `get_my_role`, `is_assigned_to_project`).
*   **Policies:** Quoted descriptive names (e.g., `"Admins can view all projects"`).

### Indexing Strategy
The schema uses a solid indexing strategy:
*   **Primary Keys:** All tables have UUID primary keys.
*   **Foreign Keys:** Indexes are automatically created for foreign key columns (`project_id`, `user_id`).
*   **RLS Performance:** Composite indexes are created on columns frequently used in RLS policies (e.g., `idx_project_assignments_user_project_role`).
*   **Query Performance:** Indexes are added for columns used in `WHERE` clauses, `ORDER BY` clauses, and for cursor pagination (e.g., `idx_projects_cursor` on `created_at`).

### Audit & Backup Ideas
*   **Audit:** The `operation_logs` table provides a good application-level audit trail. For a lower-level audit, Supabase offers tools like `pgAudit`.
*   **Backup:** Regular, automated database backups should be configured from the Supabase dashboard. It is critical to test the restoration process periodically.

### Future Extensibility Tips
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** The `company_id` in `user_profiles` is the first step. To make the app fully multi-tenant, this `company_id` should be added to the `projects` table, and all RLS policies would need an additional check for `company_id`.
*   **Notifications:** A `notifications` table could be added. Triggers on other tables (e.g., when `stock_items.quantity` falls below `low_stock_threshold`) could insert records into this table to create an in-app notification system.
*   **Reporting Module:** For more advanced reporting, consider integrating a dedicated reporting tool or using Supabase RPC functions that aggregate data into complex JSON objects suitable for charting libraries.
