## ⚙️ Setup & Installation  

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Dart SDK ^3.10.7
- A Supabase account and project
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)

### ✅ 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalyan1421/Clivi-Management.git
cd Clivi-Management/civil_management
```

### ✅ 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### ✅ 3. Setup Environment Variables
1. Create the `.env` file in the `assets` folder:
```bash
touch assets/.env
```

2. Add your Supabase credentials to `assets/.env`:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# App Environment (development, staging, production)
APP_ENV=development

# Debug Mode (enables Supabase debug logging)
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

**Getting Supabase Credentials:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (or create a new one)
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon/public** key

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env` to version control! The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`.

### ✅ 4. Run Database Migrations
See `supabase/SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on setting up the Supabase database.

**Quick Setup:**
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run migrations in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/002_fix_rls_policies.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/003_add_blueprints.sql`

### ✅ 5. Generate Code (if using freezed/riverpod_generator)
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### ✅ 6. Run the App
```bash
# Run on connected device
flutter run

# Run with specific flavor
flutter run --debug

# Run on web
flutter run -d chrome
```
